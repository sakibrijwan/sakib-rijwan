Test cases for CoCoin app testing

Test cases:
1.	Sign in with valid password
2.	Add expenses in correct category and verify the amount is added to that category
3.	Check expenses according to date
4.	Use the color code for upper limit of the expense
5.	Limit monthly expense
6.	Sort the expense type
7.	Verify the pie chat according to the expenses
8.	Verify the bar chart according to the expenses
9.	Change password feature

Possibilities of automating proposed test cases:
Unit testing level test cases:
1.	Sign in with valid password
2.	Add expenses in correct category and verify the amount is added to that category
3.	Check expenses according to date
Pros: 
Automating these cases in Unit testing level should confirm that the basic functionality of the app is working.
Cons:
Unit testing of this cases would take more time and development time will increase. 

Integration testing level test cases:
1.	Limit monthly expense
2.	Sort the expense type
3.	Verify the pie chat according to the expenses
4.	Verify the bar chart according to the expenses
5.	Change password feature

Pros:
These cases would not affect the basic functionality but should be tested as a whole for better user experience.
Cons:
Date related testing would not be realistic as to view past data, tester need to reset the system date.

System testing level cases:
1.	Use the color code for upper limit of the expense
Pros:
This case also would not affect the basic functionality and would be tested in system level to verify the final build.
Cons:
There may be chance of failing, in that case the release time may be delayed
